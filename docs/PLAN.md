# monkey v0.7.0 — complete core Prefab recovery

Development version: **0.7.0.dev1**. Formal 0.6.0 and fixed local consumer packages remain unchanged. This is the active plan; the prior status below is historical.

## Current scope — 2026-10-30

Latest ordinary-Editor check supersedes the earlier Creator native-field pass as a candidate exit: opening the source detail Prefab exposed a parent background drawn after its child content. The common RenderFlow planner now submits normal parent renderers before descendants, retaining explicit sort values and mask/sort-root boundaries. Regenerate both targets and repeat native plus ordinary-Editor checks. The source queue and its generated readback agreeing with each other did not prove correct source rendering semantics. Current Unity work also preserves exact parent transform bases and source zero-axis scales and rebuilds clipped Images without losing their cull state. The candidate remains unaccepted until these changes pass.

After regeneration, ordinary Creator Prefab view displays the source title, labels and buttons again. Clicking the Editor's normal Save exposed a separate persistence defect: preview suppression layers were serialized on source Nodes because only the importer invoked the presenter's serialization guard. Preserve the before/after evidence and repair ordinary serialization, then recheck source layers and reopen. Native import/save helpers alone do not satisfy this ordinary-Editor gate.

The current work-in-progress checkpoint preserves the dual-Editor save/reload fixes and their neutral tests before the next repair increment. The next required exit is thirty of thirty selected source Prefabs passing static-field/resource-reference and native execution checks on each target. Preserve the existing successful unchanged evidence; repair common parsing, native carrying, persistence or verification causes. Source-null/dynamic-only exclusions require exact evidence. Do not use page/UUID/game-hash special cases, remove fields or convert nonempty references to null to pass. Creator identity/count/version failure must be decomposed and resolved. Visual review remains pending and dynamic business remains disabled/partial. The checkpoint is not this exit condition.

Checkpoint `696c376b0b9d83dfd6511913a529bf9b1a2fd3b2` was pushed to `origin/codex/v0.7-prefab-recovery`; remote readback matched. A second work-in-progress checkpoint `595973f6399392f0dfe0640c8c4951050ae8f0ea` was pushed and remote SHA read back before continuing the static-field repair. Later work remains local. This is work in progress, not a formal release. Then expand the original thirteen selected Prefabs to thirty distinct representative source Prefabs, with frozen source identities/hashes and component-coverage reasons. Dependency Prefabs and alternate states do not inflate the thirty-item denominator.

Run actual Creator 3.8.8 and Unity 6000.6.2f1 import/compile, load/instantiate, required fixed-state initialization, reference resolution and affected save/reload checks in bounded groups. Keep disabled/partial business behavior and unavailable dependencies explicit. This iteration does not require per-page screenshot comparisons; visual status is `pending_user_review`. Provide one existing-capability viewing entry point and per-target results for user review. No main/tag/Release, global installation or game-project changes are authorized.

The pushed checkpoint adds source-declaration-derived typed fields, nested Prefab synchronization, static state/list projection, font/outline fixes and optional native Spine/material bindings. The thirty-root source selection is frozen: seventeen additional roots are outside the original dependency closure. Normalization retains thirty selected roots and fifty-two closure Prefabs; a source ClickEvent value is preserved separately from node components. Source-defined packed colors and contradictory primitive decorators preserve actual values. The new font probe reports no missing required source glyphs. All fifty-one Spine resource identities have native Creator probe evidence; known dynamic no-bone-motion diagnostics remain separate from static identity.

Current native execution completed Creator import, serialization and save/reload for all fifty-two closure Prefabs (thirty selected roots). Geometry, RichText, static-time materials and native animation assets passed their scoped checks. Overall static verification remains partial because source business fields still include unsupported or dynamic references, and three source Spine components have no statically assigned SkeletonData. These are not complete UI/gameplay acceptance.

Unity has created and verified all fifty-one Spine data assets. Native execution exposed and fixed source alpha import, deterministic material creation, empty initial Spine poses, actual UI submesh material binding, outline Sprite-frame resolution, repeated full-plan parsing and TMP outline material lifecycle. The fixed official Spine source now has a separate hash-verified Editor assembly pair, with the original Player assemblies retained and excluded from Editor; actual Editor assembly loading has passed. UI-color, outline and static-time shaders declare the clip rectangle and explicitly warm the mask variants. The final Unity candidate completed all fifty-two Prefab save/reload checks, with 52/52 supported native reference checks, zero missing scripts, scene reopen and editable roundtrip. Creator completed the same fifty-two closure Prefabs. All thirty selected roots now have per-target native-flow evidence and a private unified review index. Whole static-field verification remains partial: unsupported Animation/ProgressBar/other source references and dynamic Spine behavior remain explicit. No visual, gameplay or full-static-restoration acceptance is claimed. Failed, superseded and deliberately interrupted candidates remain distinct.

The older ten-of-thirteen visual gate and counts below are historical and superseded for this iteration. They remain evidence of earlier limits, not the current exit requirement.

## Historical acceptance and work before scope expansion

Freeze all 13 proposed core Prefabs against original source identities, resources and code. At least 10 distinct core Prefabs must pass both Creator 3.8.8 and Unity 6000.6.2f1: source-to-IR completeness, target native hierarchy/components/fields/references, static images/text/materials/layout in a source-evidenced fixed state, save/reopen and deterministic regeneration. Business scripts may be disabled, not run or partial, with all source fields and references retained. Dynamic behavior and physical input are a separate second phase. Unknown components remain in the source denominator. No acceptance by file counts or zero MissingScript alone.

A is original source/version evidence; B is the frozen pre-v0.7 pure monkey output; C is v0.7 pure output; D is the manually repaired game, used only for locating differences. Game repair scripts must not participate in B/C. Original server gaps remain explicit in the dynamic phase; they do not block independently proven static acceptance. Private source and sample receipts stay outside public artifacts.

Execution order: freeze source identities and baseline; implement independent component/field/reference/event accounting; fix shared source and target semantics; close static component/field/resource bindings; run isolated native/static-render/save-reopen/regeneration checks for each sample. Then extend dynamic scripts/events and input independently. Shared IR and targets have one primary writer. Reuse beaver for applicable native operations; coordinate Editor ownership before execution.

Current: all 13 source anchors are mapped; one instance variant retains an explicit base/override distinction. Original package bytes independently confirm the recovered code bundle and its version literal. Independent node/component/field accounting is integrated into normalization. The initial eleven-core baseline contains 627 nodes, 935 components and 181 custom occurrences (51 classes); these are not the larger dependency-closure totals.

Native subset import/save/reopen has run in both editors. Eleven Creator and four Unity source-bound local behavior components are emitted with unresolved semantics retained. Sixteen selected Spine resources pass Creator resource-reference and observed bone-motion probes; this is not yet Prefab component or visual acceptance. Unity native save/reopen now verifies 928 source nodes across 22 closure Prefabs, separately accounting for 68 TMP-generated nonpersistent submeshes. Source-pinned static fallback and DynamicOS fonts survive Editor exit with zero file-hash diagnostics; this is native subset evidence, not full core acceptance. Exact UI-color material references pass Creator native readback. User-provided visual references cover order states, shop scroll positions, avatar, handbook, goose details and construction; the user explicitly permits cross-version references, with versions recorded separately. Static component/field/resource binding and visual comparison remain incomplete. Static accepted samples: 0/13 on each target; dynamic accepted samples: 0/13; versionComplete=false. Source-family/CDN expansion including 3.8.5 is deferred. Only the explicitly authorized development-branch push is permitted; no formal release, global install or game writes.

## Integration checkpoint and current increment

All existing branch tips are contained in the verified development-branch checkpoint `6109a8b24067a0217ec48c31f4d8700571a6f4ff`; main, tags and formal release were not changed. The branch ledger is in [integration record](BRANCH-INTEGRATION-20261029.md).

The subsequent static-field increment preserves 217 custom components and 694 serialized fields from the existing dependency closure in both target plans. These are conversion-time records, not native field-carrier acceptance. Existing resources are hash-verified and reused. Declaration defaults and native binding remain unverified; all 217 retain their unsupported native disposition. A separate seven-criterion acceptance evaluator and thirteen-core matrix keep dynamic status independent. Static accepted cores remain 0/13 on both targets.

Next: derive typed field carriers and missing defaults from source declarations, bind exact native object references, then close representative fixed-state renders and save/reopen/regeneration using existing evidence. Prefer the source-evidenced shop and handbook states; GuideTalk asynchronous behavior stays outside this static critical path.

## Static-first convergence

First-phase exit: at least ten of the existing thirteen core Prefabs pass on both targets. Record source_identity, hierarchy, components_fields, asset_references, static_render, save_reopen and regenerate independently for every sample and target. All seven must pass; dynamic_behavior and physical_input remain separate. Never replace the core denominator with dependency closure counts.

Preserve all source components through native mappings or generated typed serializable field/reference carriers with business behavior disabled. Empty fieldless shells and zero MissingScript counts do not prove completeness. Carriers must be derived from source declarations, not game-specific templates. Distinguish serialized defaults from source-evidenced display states; missing display evidence remains unverified for the affected sample.

Reuse unchanged source freeze, font/material and 928-node native evidence. GuideTalk asynchronous typing, animation and close lifecycle no longer block the first static result. Select representative cores by available static evidence and close their real graphics render, save/reopen and regeneration gaps in bounded groups.

Visual collection previously used Unity Null graphics, producing invalid gray PNGs. Native import has an explicit `--render-preview` option; capture rejects Null devices. Isolated previews activate only the root on a disposable clone and disclose that scope. Actual rendering is evidence to compare, not automatic visual acceptance. Reference versions remain explicit; cross-version screenshots are not same-version pixel proof.

## Generality requirement

The production recovery path must derive business behavior from source parsing and AST/IR lowering, not select handwritten game-specific templates by source hash, UUID or class name. Source hashes bind evidence and reuse; they are not business implementation selectors. Project-specific WeekTask and Goose WIP has been preserved privately and removed from the production package and public test suite. It is reference analysis only and contributes no complete acceptance.

The same production entry point must be tested with renamed symbols/UUIDs/paths, changed sorting and thresholds, and an independent neutral source example. Generated behavior must follow the changed source. Unsupported semantics remain partial. Existing finite known-behavior adapters require a separate scope audit and must not be reported as general JavaScript conversion. Native font/layout/material/resource fixes continue independently; the ten-core dual-target goal is unchanged.

## Historical pre-v0.7 status

# monkey release and implementation status

Current version: **0.6.0**. This release consolidates the native recovery branch and the source-toolkit branch on `main`; older implementation branches are preserved in history. Retired formatting/engine-emulation code is not revived by consolidation.

## Implemented scope

- Source-format parsing, resource acquisition with exact identities, project manifests and ownership-aware candidate export.
- Large-project parse budgets, stage reuse and explicit missing-source classification.
- Complete-source C# draft emission, source-linked diagnostics, optional bounded postprocessing, and a five-layer native architecture workflow.
- Serial module execution, exact checkpoint recovery, inherited-member evidence, immutable reassembly and pinned candidate revisions.
- Seven received source-side toolkit commands with compatible IDs, arguments, reports and exit codes.

## Evidence boundaries

A representative private candidate with 1,555 C# files compiled across all five actual assemblies with no errors and 3,249 warnings. An affected native core integration passed source-coordinate, 24 Sprite identity, 348-cell rendering, production/persistence/reopen and out-of-viewport rejection checks. Private source material and raw identity logs are excluded from public Git and distribution artifacts. These are historical scoped observations, not a publicly reproduced full-game acceptance.

Partial/unreviewed logic, unavailable original-server behavior and source gaps remain explicit. Physical input, original visual comparison, complete gameplay and Player builds are not implied. Two Editor Search startup exceptions remain recorded in the private evidence.

## Formal release

- Package, CLI and public metadata use 0.6.0.
- Preserve MIT and required third-party attribution, stable compatibility/API identifiers and public download URLs.
- Review the exact staged tree and distributions for private material before publishing `v0.6.0`.
- Verify remote main/tag/Release state and downloaded artifact hashes.
- Coordinate global installation through the designated integration owner; repository release work does not concurrently uninstall or replace shared installations.

Detailed public contracts remain in the adjacent documentation. Private coordination, source evidence and pre-redaction originals are retained outside the release tree.

## Bounded local maintenance

The active local branch addresses one received Unity 2021.3 SpriteAtlas resource subset: exact packing-bit interpretation, original float geometry and UVs, explicit DDS/DXT5 cache hydration, and ordered native Sprite identity readback. Original inputs remain immutable; candidate assets and raw evidence stay outside Git. The formal 0.6.0 release and global installation are not modified. Completion requires the affected source-to-native mapping and precise unsupported-case diagnostics, not another full-game export.

The affected resource subset passed Unity 6000.6.2f1 import/save/reopen: 29 ordered Sprite references, original float32 vertices and triangle topology, actual GUID/localFileID readback and exact native texture pixels. A separately bound source SpriteAtlas confirmed the packing/UV interpretation. A minimal native-asset closure and frame mapping are retained privately for consumer adoption. Game runtime wiring, visual parity and gameplay remain unverified by this maintenance. See [bounded atlas contract](providers/UNITY-ATLAS-SUBSET.md) for limits and importer policy.

A follow-up local resource request found two additional frozen leaf-Prefab closures outside the supplied dependency pool. Their bound source atlases contain 35 and 34 frames and require the narrow FlipHorizontal/Rotate180 settings (69/77), now interpreted as reflections about the serialized atlas rectangle. Source-control vertex/topology checks are exact; the existing UV arithmetic tolerance is unchanged. Independent candidate generation reuses the same DDS/profile chain without repeating the full input pool. Both candidates passed native import/save/reopen, all 69 ordered Sprite identities and exact texture pixel readback; the 38 focused tests also passed. The minimal consumer closure has 69 Sprites, two textures and their metadata, with original field order and per-frame mappings. Native consumer handoff remains separate from game runtime integration and publication.

Another local hydration extension accepts frozen literal cache buckets and an optional source-SHA/file/pathID/raw-SHA/logical-path selection manifest. It atomically hydrates a bounded explicit Texture2D set while retaining all unselected bytes and reporting unprocessed textures as deferred. A partial derivative remains nonzero CLI status and cannot imply whole-container success. Private synthetic two-texture UnityFS cases exercise the real pinned UnityPy/ASTC/DDS workers with 256x512 pixels in bucket 256; consumer source/native acceptance is still separate. See [exact texture selection](providers/UNITY-TEXTURE-SELECTION.md). No formal release or shared installation is replaced.

The follow-up selected PNG outlet now bypasses the whole-container exporter entirely: it binds the original, selected derivative, selector and externally pinned hydration receipt, independently checks unselected bytes and selected RGBA pixels, and emits only PNG candidates with provenance/importer-intent metadata. Partial container state is retained, no native GUID/import is claimed, and the consumer owns controlled adoption. A synthetic 225-texture case covers one exported texture with 224 deferred keys without deleting or decoding those unrelated objects.

## Local P0 Shader evidence handoff

The approved P0 adds a content-first Shader classifier and `classify-unity-shaders` for existing frozen candidates. `monkey-shader-handoff/1` separates recognizable source candidates, platform-compiled data, recovered binary evidence, unknown content and unsupported asset kinds. Native compilation remains `not_run`; source-text only requests source review. New recovery inventories carry explicit Shader hold/review dispositions, without removing referenced evidence or changing legacy exported-file counts into runtime approval.

The bounded existing-candidate check classified 126 serialized platform-compiled Shaders and one unsupported variant collection, hashing about 5.5 MB of Shader/meta content rather than rerunning the full pool. All 127 target identities are serialized declarations, not native readback. The old source map lacks original object associations for the 126 Shaders; these remain explicitly unmapped, with no name-based ID or raw hash inference. A neutral consumer-contract check is accepted by beaver's read-only planner and remains blocked for unproven dynamic runtime use; it is not Editor or isolation-execution evidence.

The fixed candidate, game project, shared installation and formal release are unchanged. beaver owns actual build target/pipeline, dependency coverage, native identities/compilation and any reversible filtering; game-directory migration remains with its owner. No P1 parser/recovery expansion is included. Public schema/example/CLI and limitations are in [Shader handoff](providers/UNITY-SHADER-HANDOFF.md).

## 2026-10-29 current static recovery acceptance

The source-generated StaticBatch10 candidate supersedes the earlier P07 checkpoint and eleven-core audit. P07's source-backed locked state now passes actual Unity 6000.6.2f1 and Creator 3.8.8 open/save/unload/reopen with visible screenshots, six complete native static carriers, and verified state operations. The full Unity independent PNG is visually checked; the live reopened layout is stable. Both windows remain on P07.

P04 and P09 also have actual dual-Editor saved/reopened screenshots. P04's missing untrimmed nine-slice border and P09's Creator RichText fontColor persistence are fixed. P04 still has a heavier Unity title and only 1/5 complete native carriers; P09 has 0/2, with explicit unresolved declarations/references. The other eight baseline pages lack fixed-state dual-Editor visual acceptance. Eleven-interface completion remains false; snapshot-json is not counted as native typed completion. Source Prefabs remain separate from derived preview states; only the latter freeze evaluated Unity layout for static display.

Private current evidence: `.private/v070-prefab-20261029/StaticBatch10/acceptance.json` and `验收说明.md`. Same-plan bounded exports reproduce all 914 Unity and 715 Creator generated files byte-for-byte; this is exporter determinism, not a second native import. 58 focused tests passed. No Player/gameplay/full-state acceptance or release is implied. Next work is the remaining actual field/reference/visual gaps, starting with P04 title rendering; do not expand accounting scaffolding or claim all eleven complete.


## Static continuation after the bounded checkpoint

Continue the original thirteen-sample matrix and source-backed component combinations; the eleven-page audit and P07 checkpoint do not complete this work. Current integration adds Creator 2.4 auto-synced nested Prefabs, source-defined list clones, typed record arrays, exact asset redirects, static COLOR Buttons and native material references. P04 font weight correction is compiled but awaits a fresh native candidate. StaticBatch11 preserves pre-Editor integration failures; none is counted as visual acceptance.

Primary owns shared preview integration, final candidate export and both Editors. Isolated modules own clone validation/helpers, P03 source fixtures/font supplementation, Spine static binding, and P05/P02 fixtures. Original source assets and prior native evidence remain immutable. All new fixture states explicitly distinguish test inputs from observed player state.


## Active static presentation closure

The development-branch checkpoint is preserved. Subsequent work remains local. The bounded thirty-root, fifty-two-Prefab closure requires actual static presentation as well as typed fields and asset references. Existing native checks for 1,035 field bindings and 334 animation reference bindings are reused. Missing Image/TMP components, masks, outlines, source sorting scopes and editable layout/constraint semantics remain required work; source-disabled or absent-font cases retain their source evidence and denominator. Particle playback and unlowered timeline/business behavior remain explicitly unexecuted; their serialized fields/resources are retained separately. Creator retained-document verification now preserves serialization-reserved source keys as opaque source text; native texture decode verification remains under repair. Visual comparison is pending user review and full static restoration remains false. Native Editors are closed only after completed/failed execution, never merely because loading is slow.


## 2026-10-30 development checkpoint and adoption

Preserve the current valid static-recovery implementation, tests and required documentation on the existing development branch before continuing repairs. This checkpoint is work in progress, not native acceptance. Complete the current thirty distinct Prefabs across both declared Editors before fixing a `v0.7.0.dev1` candidate identity and providing the native matrix, local tool entry, boundaries and adoption steps. Adopt only needed modules in the existing Unity/Go consumer project without overwriting business logic or forcing a full reimport. Generic conversion defects remain tool work; product behavior remains consumer work. No main merge, release tag, public Release or global install is authorized by this checkpoint. Visual comparison remains pending user review; dynamic business is outside this static pass.


Continuation after checkpoint `9f590c90f73d5787e478a91dff8c9bb0e29c0227`: keep the current static recovery route and team. Resolve the current TMP character/material proof and Creator generated RichText Label field failures, then continue the unchanged native matrix. Handling import prompts or answering side questions does not complete this version. Known verified TMP Essential Resources prompts are handled by the primary operator. Full native acceptance and the dev1 candidate remain pending.

Ordinary Editor follow-up remains part of acceptance. The goose Prefab was saved and reopened through Unity's native menus with unchanged saved bytes. Creator's ordinary Prefab serializer exposed source-layer persistence and nested override defects that its earlier import/readback pipeline did not cover; both are tracked separately from native generation. A warm Creator undo snapshot error disappears after a cold reopen of the same bytes, but restart is diagnostic evidence, not its fix. The full matrix remains incomplete while these issues and later Unity TMP/Spine cases are under verification.


Creator ordinary-save follow-up now passes in the current bounded candidate: the goose and nested-card Prefabs were opened, saved, closed and reopened through the Editor, then all fifty-two saved Prefabs were freshly read again and independently verified. Source fields, layers, nested identities and pre-existing overrides are preserved; screenshots are retained for user review. Exact owned-object undo and retired-scene cleanup fixes pass repeated in-session readback without resetting user undo state. Unity remains under native verification; full dual-Editor acceptance and the fixed dev1 identity are still pending.


## 2026-10-31 bounded dev1 static acceptance

The current development candidate passes native static verification for all thirty selected distinct Prefabs and the complete fifty-two-Prefab dependency closure in Unity 6000.6.2f1 and Creator 3.8.8. Both Editors actually imported and saved the native assets; the goose Prefab was opened, saved, exited and reopened through native menus with screenshots. The final Unity goose file stayed byte-identical after ordinary saving. Creator also passed ordinary nested-Prefab saving and a fresh saved-asset reread; source layers, identities, fields and existing overrides remain intact. Independent verification uses the frozen native binding-plan bytes and exact source/asset/mesh identities, retaining the original geometry threshold.

This is the bounded v0.7.0.dev1 development candidate, not a formal release or full-game acceptance. Unity overall Editor status remains partial only for explicitly unexecuted dynamic Spine behavior and unlowered animation curves; native static validation passes. Visual review is pending the user, and source-empty/disabled states remain source-empty/disabled. Player interaction, dynamic callbacks, particle playback and business behavior are not accepted by this pass. The input blocker capture override applies only outside Play mode; Player retains its original lifecycle behavior, which has not been physically tested here. Adoption uses the fixed development identity and only required modules in the existing consumer project.
