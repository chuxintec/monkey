# Native code architecture contract

`monkey.code_architecture_contract.validate_architecture(plan, catalog)` is a
small, read-only structural gate for a source-bound native Unity architecture
plan. It returns deterministic class asset paths, counts, and the fixed
five-layer assembly reference matrix. Invalid input raises the existing
`monkey.sources.compiled.ParseError` with code `CODE_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT`, a
field location, and a short reason.

The accepted plan schema is `monkey-native-code-architecture/1`. The plan's
`sourceManifestSha256` must exactly match the lowercase SHA-256 identity on the
catalog. Every catalog source unit must occur exactly once in `sourceCoverage`
with a supported disposition and a nonempty reason. Class and module IDs,
source links, declared module membership, entry point, and integration-chain
references are checked for consistency. Class output paths follow
`Assets/Game/<Layer>/<Module path>/<Name>.cs`; module identifiers use dot
segments, which become directories. `rootNamespace`, module names, class names,
field names, method names, and parameter names are checked as non-keyword C#
identifiers.

Allowed same-layer and cross-layer references are constrained as follows:

| Layer | Allowed source-level dependencies | Assembly references |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | Domain | none |
| Gameplay | Domain, Gameplay | Domain |
| Presentation | Domain, Gameplay, Presentation | Domain, Gameplay |
| Services | Domain, Gameplay, Services | Domain, Gameplay |
| Bootstrap | all five layers | Domain, Gameplay, Presentation, Services |

The plan's `dependsOn` lists name layers and may include the owning layer for
intra-layer relationships. `typeDependencies` lists actual target class IDs; each
reference must exist and respect the declared layer edge. Method `sourceMemberIds`
must belong to the class's declared source units. Large input member catalogs may
be sharded; the stage restores and verifies them before structural validation.
The returned `assemblyReferences` excludes the
owning assembly itself. Core Domain and Gameplay field, parameter, return, and
declared base types (`base` or `baseType`, if supplied) may not use `dynamic`, Unity engine/editor types, or
`Dictionary<string, object>` as a catch-all representation.

Each integration chain must reference Bootstrap, Gameplay, Domain, and
Presentation classes; provide at least one relative JSON configuration file
path; and carry nonempty behavior text. All configuration and asset paths must
be relative file paths without traversal. This checks path shape and declared
composition only: it does not read files or prove that a path exists, that a
configuration was loaded, or that the described behavior ran.

The validator is bounded to 8,000,000 input values and nesting depth 96, accepts
JSON-like dictionaries/lists, and performs no I/O. It deliberately does not
require every planned class or method to compile, every source unit to map to a
new class, or unknown source behavior to be implemented. It does not generate
Unity code and does not claim source restoration, successful compilation,
runtime integration, or gameplay equivalence.
